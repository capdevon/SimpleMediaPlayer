# SimpleMediaPlayer

Optimized version of the project https://github.com/polincdev/SimpleMediaPlayer

NEW [Class-Diagram](images/smp-class-diagram.jpg)


Some graphic effects don't work, I don't have the necessary knowledge to fix shaders. Any suggestions are welcome.

```java
mediaPlayer.getEffectManager().enableLineEffect(true); //doesn't work
mediaPlayer.getEffectManager().enableGrainEffect(true); //doesn't work
mediaPlayer.getEffectManager().enableVignetteEffect(true); //doesn't work
mediaPlayer.getEffectManager().enableCRTEffect(true); //doesn't work
```
